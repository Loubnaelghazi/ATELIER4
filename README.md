# Objective : The main purpose behind this lab is to get familiar with NLP language models
using Pytorch library.

## Overview
This LAB involves 3 parts :
Part1 Classification /Regression
Part 2 Transformer (Text generation)
Part 3 BERT

## Part 1
The preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Tokenization
- Stemming
- Lemmatization
- Stop words removal
- Text discretization

## Part 2
I used the following techniques for vectorization:
- Word2Vec (CBOW and Skip Gram)
- Bag of Words
- TF-IDF

## Part 3
For regression tasks, I trained:
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Naive Bayes
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree

For classification tasks, I trained:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Ada Boosting
